<h1 id="label-Security+and+User-Supplied+Code">Security and User-Supplied Code</h1>

<p>Demiurge is designed for an environment with very high-privilege code (e.g.
Demiurge itself, framework code, setup code) and somewhat lower-privilege
code (e.g. world files, certain player actions, display code like
particles.) It is <em>not</em> designed to let you just “drop in” untrusted
code and expect everything will be fine, basically ever.</p>

<h2 id="label-Sandboxing">Sandboxing</h2>

<p>In general, “sandboxing” code to prevent it from doing things you don&#39;t
want is very hard. Ruby does nothing to make this easier - only a few
languages are easy to “sandbox”, with JavaScript being by far the most
advanced in that specific respect – it&#39;s designed to run in the browser
environment in a very specifically sandboxed way.</p>

<p>There are a few Ruby sandbox implementations (the current leader seems to
be <a href=""https://github.com/jwo/jruby-sandbox"">JRuby Sandbox</a>), but
in general they&#39;re hard to get right. Proving that a particular Ruby
snippet can&#39;t access a particular class (say ObjectSpace, which gives
full access to 100% of everything, or any flavor of “eval,” or “binding,”
or…) is very, very hard.</p>

<p>So: the current Demiurge codebase makes a much simpler assumption: there
are two overall flavors of code and neither is safe.</p>

<p>The first flavor is administrative code. Anything that runs with full
privilege (actions marked as full-privilege, anything in a framework file
or other non-World dot-rb file) must be examined very carefully. These are
full-danger code that can do absolutely anything, and you must trust such
code as much as the code you wrote for yourself. They can do anything you
can do, and running them “just for this one person” without fully examining
them is a terrible, terrible idea.</p>

<h2 id="label-World+Code">World Code</h2>

<p>The second flavor is world code. Non-administrative zones, actions for
locations and agents and other similar code is world code. It runs with
more restrictions. It doesn&#39;t have methods to directly call most
dangerous operations like reloading your world from a state dump or
reloading a zone. You still have to examine it - a creative Ruby coder can
potentially get at just about anything they want to. But the basic
operations it provides are less dangerous, and a very simple chunk of world
code will normally not be able to do anything <em>too</em> awful.</p>

<p>However, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>
guarantees that we can&#39;t make many guarantees about what code does, and
we certainly can&#39;t be sure it returns in a crisp, predictable manner in
general. So: assume that even world code, even very simple world code, can
cause you significant problems.</p>

<h2 id="label-Special+Cases">Special Cases</h2>

<p>There are very restricted cases where you can be sure that everything is
fine. As an intentionally-silly example, if you let the player supply a
six-digit hexadecimal color value and then apply it to be the color of
something using CSS… That&#39;s pretty darn securable. If you want to make
that safe, you totally can.</p>

<p>And as an intermediate-difficulty thing, it&#39;s not hard to come up with
a definition language for things like particle effects that only have a few
operations, limited conditionals and no loops, which are essentially safe.
At most a bad world-builder might be able to slow down people&#39;s
browsers, which isn&#39;t a huge deal.</p>

<p>But in general, if a language is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
Complete</a> then there&#39;s a way to make it misbehave in a way you
can&#39;t automatically detect. Which means any language interesting enough
to build a world in is also interesting enough to cause you lots of
problems with securing it automatically.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still not a bad idea to build special cases. Those are where
you&#39;ll be able to let <em>players</em> supply content without carefully
vetting it. If you need world-builders to write zones in Ruby then you need
to have somebody review the code manually - there&#39;s not going to be an
enforcement system that&#39;s good enough to catch all the problems. But if
you want players to color their own gear or even make up their own custom
particle effects, that&#39;s probably not a problem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising how much you can do with a special-purpose language or
format for just a few specific things. CSS in your browser is an example of
how far you can take this idea, though these days CSS is Turing Complete
too…</p>

<h2 id="label-How+Do+We+Do+It+Right-3F">How Do We Do It Right?</h2>

<p>There is an eventual solution that could help this a fair bit, at a cost of
performance and complexity. By running a separate Ruby process with limited
privilege, it could become possible to halt a runaway chunk of world code
and watch its operations more carefully - it&#39;s always easier to monitor
a chunk of Ruby code from <em>outside</em> that Ruby process.</p>

<p>That gets around problems with the various sandbox libraries – how do you
avoid them using 100% CPU and never returning? How do you get around them
allocating unlimited memory? These aren&#39;t problems you can get around
with a Ruby-space sandbox library, not really. You need to run the code
evaluation in a separate process so that you can limit those things without
putting your limiting code in the same Ruby interpreter, where “bad actor”
code can get at it.</p>
