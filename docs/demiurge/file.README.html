<p>Demiurge is an experimental game state and simulation library.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Add this line to your application&#39;s Gemfile:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_gem'>gem</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>demiurge</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>And then execute:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Or install it yourself as:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ gem install demiurge
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>See test mini-games in the test directory. For more information, see
lib/demiurge/engine.rb.</p>

<p>For longer-term usage, Demiurge will normally be part of a larger
program. Its intent is to manage behavior and state for a game or
similar simulated world. In those cases, Demiurge will normally be
required as a gem by its application, using normal &quot;require
&#39;demiurge&#39;&quot;-style declarations. You can see what that looks like by
examining test/example mini-worlds in the relevant Demiurge
directories.</p>

<p>If Demiurge is primarily managing a simulated world and you want to
view the results, you&#39;ll need a display library to make its output
visible. Currently that means Demiurge-CreateJS, which displays the
results in your browser as a simulated world.</p>

<p>Please note that it is very, very difficult to separate the specifics
of behavior from the specifics of output and display - entities simply
<em>behave</em> differently in a text-only world with generalized &quot;locations&quot;
than they do in a 2D grid or a 3D world with collisions. As a result,
even if your preferred method of output isn&#39;t as specific as &quot;Unreal
Engine&quot; or &quot;browser game&quot; or &quot;MUD-style text game,&quot; your simulation is
going to have a strong &quot;flavor&quot; of whatever underlying physics you
select. There is no such thing as &quot;just plain physics, with no strong
bias that changes the behavior of agents within it.&quot;</p>

<p>This README doesn&#39;t tell you everything about creating and simulating
a world with Demiurge. See CONCEPTS.md for an initial grounding in
those ideas.</p>

<h2>Demiurge DSL (World Files)</h2>

<p>Demiurge contains an optional Domain-Specific Language (also called a
&quot;DSL&quot;) which can be used to specify your simulated world and its rules
and behaviors. The &quot;test&quot; directory contains some examples of these
files.</p>

<p>These DSLs may specify various sorts of locations and agents that roam
them - the idea is that the world files should specify enough details
to simulate the &quot;world&quot; fully, without containing too much additional
detail on how to supply the results. Since many formats tend to pack
this information together (e.g. TMX files contain layout and collision
data required for simulation, but also links to image files for
display) the Demiurge engine will often link to the display
information without using it. This permits a display layer on top of
Demiurge, such as Demiurge-CreateJS, to make use of the display
information alongside the simulation data.</p>

<h2>Specific Technologies: 2D Tile Maps</h2>

<p>Remember that &quot;no such thing as just plain physics&quot; bit above? As a
consequence, Demiurge contains support for specific, non-abstract
physics bits like &quot;2d grid of defined terrains,&quot; also called a tilemap
or tiled terrain.</p>

<p>There are standards for tilemaps, such as TMX format and the Tiled map
editor (<a href="http://mapeditor.org">http://mapeditor.org</a>). TMX support also, not coincidentally,
gives you a fairly rich source of existing media to use (e.g. The Mana
Project and Source of Tales.) Please be careful to appropriately
respect the licensing of this media, which requires an acknowledgement
to the original authors for your graphics and map files.</p>

<p>2D tile-based media is rich enough to provide interesting simulation
and AI behaviors without being <em>so</em> interesting that your agent code
can&#39;t be in scripting languages and spends all its time doing
pathfinding, as would be the case with most open 3D environments.</p>

<h2>Specific Technologies: Serializability and Immutability</h2>

<p>One of the hard challenges in game- and world-based AI is how to make
it easy to create new content, primarily in the form of reactions and
behavior. Those reactions and behavior are most frequently expressed
as some form of code/scripts.</p>

<p>Reactions and behavior can take many forms. Two common ones are called
Intentions and Actions by Demiurge. An Intention is generated by an
artificial intelligence based on examining its current situation. For
instance, &quot;I am hungry and I remember food in the next room, so I
intend to move in that direction.&quot; An Intention will examine the state
of the world, but will not normally change it.</p>

<p>An Action is normally the result of an Intention, and it applies that
intention to the simulated world. An Action will frequently change the
state of the world, such as by moving an agent within the world, or by
moving other non-agent items in the world (e.g. eating food, picking up a
stick, etc.) An Action may also frequently be thwarted (e.g. an item
is too heavy, food is not where it was suspected or remembered,
somebody has pushed their way into the hall ahead of you and you may
not pass.)</p>

<p>Immutable structures provide great verifiability and terrible
performance. The code snippets can generate a second, modified version
of each structure, but must copy nearly the entirety of it. You may be
certain that no old state is being modified in a sloppy way, and
memory usage and garbage collection time are both very high.</p>

<p>Mutable structures allow easy in-place modification for great
performance, but they&#39;re hard to lock down when mutability isn&#39;t
wanted (e.g. when verifying if an action is allowed to take place.)</p>

<p>Demiurge attempts to handle this by making the code immutable per run
of the world, and to store state data in sometimes-mutable
JSON-serializable structures.</p>

<p>It is assumed but only sometimes verified that when calculating
Intentions the state of the world isn&#39;t altered. It is assumed that
the behaviors are replicatable -- that random numbers generated from
seeds are used in a way that is replicatable from run to run, for
instance, or non-random behaviors reliably calculate the same
intention from the same preconditions.</p>

<p>This provides a compromise between full immutability (slow
performance, great verifiability) and full mutability (fast
performance, terrible verifiability) by switching back and forth
between them on demand.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Demiurge is not yet ready for &quot;pristine&quot; production usage. It&#39;s not
yet ready for you to just drop it in and use it unchanged. For that
reason, assume you&#39;ll need to do some Demiurge development for
yourself, whether or not you ever contribute it upstream.</p>

<p>For more information on Demiurge&#39;s architecture, see the HACKING.md
document in this directory.</p>

<p>After checking out the repo, run <code>bin/setup</code> to install
dependencies. Then, run <code>rake test</code> to run the tests. You can also run
<code>bin/console</code> for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.</p>

<p>To install this gem onto your local machine, run <code>bundle exec rake
install</code>. To release a new version, update the version number in
<code>version.rb</code>, and then run <code>bundle exec rake release</code>, which will
create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push
the <code>.gem</code> file to <a href="https://rubygems.org">rubygems.org</a>.</p>
