<p>This entire file feels like a plugin waiting to happen. Putting it into
Demiurge and monkeypatching seems slightly weird and “off”. There&#39;s
nothing wrong with having TiledLocation in Demiurge, and we do. But TMX,
specifically, has a lot of format-specific stuff that doesn&#39;t seem to
belong in core Demiurge. That&#39;s part of why it&#39;s off by itself in a
separate file. If we were to support a second tilemap format, that would
definitely seem to belong in a plugin. It&#39;s not clear what makes TMX
different other than it being the first supported map format. The only
thing keeping this from being the “demiurge-tmx” gem is that I feel like
the code is already diced too finely into gems for its current level of
maturity.</p>

<p>Demiurge::Tmx is the module for Tmx internals. This includes Tmx parsing,
caching and general encapsulation.</p>

<p>TMX support here includes basic/normal TMX support for products of the
Tiled map editor (see “<a href="http://mapeditor.org">mapeditor.org</a>”
and “<a
href="http://docs.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/tmx-map-format">docs.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/tmx-map-format</a>/”)
and more complex tiled map support for formats based on the ManaSource game
engine, including variants like Source of Tales, Land of Fire, The Mana
World and others. For more information on the ManaSource mapping format,
see “<a
href="http://doc.manasource.org/mapping.html">doc.manasource.org/mapping.html</a>”.</p>

<p>In general, Tiled and “raw” TMX try to be all things to all games. If you
can use a tile editor for it, Tiled would like to do that for you.
ManaSource is a more specialized engine and introduces new concepts like
named “Fringe” layers to make it clear how a humanoid sprite walks through
the map, named “Collision” layers for walkability and swimmability,
known-format “objects” for things like doors, warps, NPCs, NPC waypoints
and monster spawns. Not all of that will be duplicated in Demiurge, but
support for such things belongs in the ManaSource-specific TMX parsing
code.</p>

<p>In the long run, it&#39;s very likely that there will be other TMX
“dialects” like ManaSource&#39;s. Indeed, Demiurge might eventually specify
its own TMX dialect to support non-ManaSource features like procedural map
generation. My intention is to add them in the same way - they may be
requested in the Demiurge World files in the DSL, and they will be an
additional parsing pass on the result of “basic” TMX parsing.</p>
