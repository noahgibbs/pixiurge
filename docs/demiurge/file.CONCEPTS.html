<h1 id="label-Demiurge+Simulated+Worlds">Demiurge Simulated Worlds</h1>

<p>Demiurge is a great way to prototype and develop an interesting simulated
world. It&#39;s intended to be flexible, powerful and easy to tie into
other systems.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the components of a Demiurge world and what they do.</p>

<h2 id="label-Engines-2C+State-2C+Ticks">Engines, State, Ticks</h2>

<p>A single Demiurge simulation is called an Engine. It can be loaded from
World Files and state.</p>

<p>World Files determine the behavior of the world - what kinds of entities
does the world contain? How do they act? What are the rules of physics that
define that world?</p>

<p>State determines the current situation of that world. If your world physics
allows any number of rabbits in a particular field, how many are there
right now and where are they?</p>

<p>A single step of simulation is called a “tick”, like the ticking of a
clock.</p>

<p>The world “entity” for a thing in the world is fairly vague. It may refer
to an “item”, a “creature”, an “area” (another vague word) or something
else. An entity is “a thing or things in the world” rather than one
specific abstraction that Demiurge defines. Entities generally can act and
be acted on, can pick things up and be picked up, can take place in a
location or be that location. In general, a single individual entity will
only do a few of those things, though.</p>

<h2 id="label-Intentions-2C+Actions+and+Events">Intentions, Actions and Events</h2>

<p>A world may contain unchanging things, usually represented as rules. It may
contain changeable and movable items. And it may contain items or creatures
that act on their own. Demiurge can distinguish between these categories,
but it usually does so by distinguishing between “rules” and “state” rather
than between “intelligent” and “unintelligent.” Intelligence is mostly a
matter of how complex the rules are, and what objects they tend to affect.</p>

<p>A Demiurge Engine normally moves forward in discrete steps. The current
state is examined to create a list of Intentions, which do not (yet) change
state. The Intentions are then resolved into notifications and state
changes. One full state/intention/event cycle is a tick.</p>

<p>Demiurge doesn&#39;t require that ticks occur at particular times according
to a real-world clock. You might choose to create entities and rules that
care about a real-world clock, but Demiurge doesn&#39;t care. Ticks can be
evenly spaced or not, as long as your entities&#39; rules reflect that.</p>

<h2 id="label-State+Items-2C+and+the+Difference+Between+Rules+and+State">State Items, and the Difference Between Rules and State</h2>

<p>Rules exist entirely within World Files and the Demiurge framework itself.
The effects of rules can change according to current state, but the rules
themselves are in the World Files and do not depend on state.</p>

<p>State in Demiurge must be serializable as JSON. That gives a combination of
numbers, strings, true/false/undefined special values, lists and objects
(dictionaries/hashes) as the set of all state data. Each State Item gets a
chunk of state and manages its own rules. Each State Item&#39;s item name
must be unique. There may be lots of a particular <em>kind</em> of state
item, but each one gets its own unique name and its own chunk of state.</p>

<p>A “State Item” applies rules to state. As a programmatic object, it can
apply its rules (which are fixed) to its state (which can change at any
time).</p>

<p>This abstraction makes it easy to consider hypotheticals – to ask, “if the
state were different in this way, how would that change the world?”</p>

<h2 id="label-Item+Naming+and+Instances">Item Naming and Instances</h2>

<p>A Demiurge entity (including Zones, Locations, Agents and many others) must
have a single, fully unique name within a given Engine. In World Files,
normally a human has to declare the name and that name needs to be unique.</p>

<p>Names have a few restrictions. You can use alphanumeric characters (letters
and numbers, including Unicode letters and numbers) along with spaces,
dashes and underscores in the names. But other punctuation including
quotes, hash signs, dollar signs and so on aren&#39;t permitted. These
names are used internally as unique identifiers and you don&#39;t need to
worry about showing them to humans, so don&#39;t worry about not being able
to put punctuation you care about in the names. The names are
case-sensitive – that is, “Bobo” and “boBo” are completely different items
because an upper-case and lower-case letter count as different from each
other.</p>

<p>Certain items, such as Zones in World Files may be reopened by declaring
another item (e.g. another Zone) with the same name. But if so, they
aren&#39;t two different Zones with the same name. Instead, the files
declare a single Zone across multiple files. That&#39;s perfectly legal,
just as you may declare a room in one World File while declaring creatures
and items inside it in another World File. But it&#39;s all a single room,
even if it&#39;s declared in multiple places for human convenience. If
you&#39;re used to programming with Ruby classes, this idea of “reopening”
the same zone in a new file will probably seem very familiar.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to declare an object and then have a lot of them.
Something like a wooden spoon, a low-level slime monster or a player body
object may get just one declaration in the World Files for a lot of
individual objects in the world. Differences in state or appearance can add
variation where you need it without requiring giant, bloated World Files
with fifteen identical slime monsters that just have a “7” or a “12” after
their name.</p>

<p>There are a few kinds of special punctuation in names and name-like things
that Demiurge may use for itself. For instance, a Position (see later in
this file) is a location&#39;s item name followed by a pound sign and then
some additional information, such as “my_room#25,71”. Certain special
objects and other things in Demiurge can use other punctuation (e.g. colon
or dollar-sign), but these shouldn&#39;t occur in human-named objects in
World Files.</p>

<h2 id="label-Events+and+State+Changes">Events and State Changes</h2>

<p>Often an Intention turns into a change of state. For example, an item is
picked up, or a person moves from one location to another. When that
occurs, there may also be one or more notifications. The state change is
what it sounds like - if a person moves from one place to another, their
“location” is part of their state, and it&#39;s different after the tick
than it was before.</p>

<p>A Notification doesn&#39;t necessarily involve a change of state, though
the two will often happen together. The Notification doesn&#39;t cause the
state change, though it may be the result of one. A Notification is simply
a discrete that can be perceived in the world. A continuous, ongoing event
is state, not a Notification, though if it begins, ends or changes
significantly it may <em>cause</em> a Notification.</p>

<p>If a person moves from one room to another, their location changes and so
their state changes. There is also likely to be a Notification associated
with it - a detectable, trackable event which can be watched for by other
reactive entities in the world.</p>

<p>A Notification doesn&#39;t have to involve a state change, though. For
instance, if a character looks around shiftily or grins momentarily, that
doesn&#39;t necessarily change any recorded part of their state. But
another character may watch for the Notification and if they detect it,
they may react to it.</p>

<h2 id="label-The+Cycle+of+a+Tick">The Cycle of a Tick</h2>

<p>Initially, the state is effectively frozen - nothing should change it. It
may be literally kept immutable in the program, depending on required
efficiency.</p>

<p>For each tick, code runs to generate Intentions on the part of any entities
that can act. Anything that will change state or create a Notification
requires an Intention.</p>

<p>Then, in some order of precedence, these Intentions are resolved one at a
time.</p>

<p>First an Intention is “validated” - can it happen at all? If not, it is
discarded as impossible, undesirable or otherwise “not going to happen”
with no effects of any kind.</p>

<p>At this point, the state becomes changeable again. This may involve
unfreezing or copying.</p>

<p>Then an Intention is offered - other entities may attempt to block, modify
or otherwise interfere with what occurs. This may result in the Intention
being blocked as in the validation stage (another entity effectively makes
its result impossible, resulting in nothing happening) or its effects may
be modified and/or other effects may immediately occur as a result.</p>

<p>As that process resolves, the Intention may modify state. It may also send
Notifications. In general, a Notification reflects a completed operation
and the receiver can only react, not change or block the action. While a
Notification allows the receiver to modify state, that receiver should only
modify its own state or send additional Notifications - it should not take
“instant reactions”, which should be resolved in the offer/modify/veto
stage.</p>

<p>After all these Notifications have resolved, including any Notifications
raised in response to other Notifications, the tick begins again with the
new state, which may be frozen during the early Intention phases.</p>

<h2 id="label-Zones-2C+Location+and+Position">Zones, Location and Position</h2>

<p>Location in Demiurge starts with the Zone. A Zone is a top-level entity
that manages state and flow of execution roughly independently of other
zones.</p>

<p>Different Zones may have very different “physics” between them - a Zone
might be entirely text descriptions, while a different Zone is managed
entirely in 2D tile graphics, for instance and a third Zone could be an
HTML UI. It&#39;s possible to do that within a single Zone in some cases,
if the Zone&#39;s “physics” permit it, but such changes are expected
between Zones.</p>

<p>A Location within a Zone may have some difference, but needs to cooperate
effectively with the Zone and with other Locations inside. In a 2D
tile-based Zone, it may be important that Zone pathfinding works across
multiple Locations, for instance. In a text-based Zone of
mostly-independent locations, there may be a notification system that
allows events in adjacent rooms to be visible in certain other rooms as
text notifications.</p>

<p>In general, a Zone defines the top-level “physics” and the nature of space
and location within itself, and Locations coordinate to make that happen.
Technically Locations are optional - it&#39;s possible for a Zone to skip
Locations entirely. But ordinarily there is some form of subdivision.</p>

<p>Locations are also allowed to contain other Locations, and may do so or not
depending on the nature of their Zone.</p>

<p>When one asks for an entity&#39;s “location”, one may mean “what entity
inside a Zone is it contained in?” However, there is not always a
well-defined answer to that question. For instance, an “infinite space”
Zone with no sub-locations that handles all object interactions directly
may not have “Location” sub-objects within itself at all. What “location”
is somebody at within the Zone? The Demiurge entity in question is just the
Zone, since there are no smaller Location entities within it.</p>

<p>And within a Location, an entity may occupy different positions. In a box
of 3D space or a 2D tile map or a MUD-style room with objects inside, a
given entity may be at “x: 27.4, y:-1547.2, z: 297.0” or “x: 27, y: 5” or
“next to the gray lamp.”</p>

<p>The Demiurge class “Demiurge::Location” is basically advisory - locations
within a Zone aren&#39;t required to belong to that class, may be part of a
tree of different location objects or may not exist at all.</p>

<p>As a result, a “location” in Demiurge is about author intention, not really
about what Demiurge does with the object in question. The Zone defines what
being a location means, and it may vary widely from Zone to Zone.</p>

<p>But then, how does one specify? With a Position.</p>

<p>A Position is given relative to a Zone or an object inside the Zone, such
as a Location (if one exists.) It is of the form “item_name#coordinates”
where “item_name” is a canonical Demiurge item name, instanced or
non-instanced. The coordinates may be in a form appropriate to their zone
such as “7,25” or “29.45/81.6/Kappa” or “left_of/gray_greasy_lamp”. The
coordinates should not contain a pound-sign, a dollar sign or other
characters that aren&#39;t legal in a Demiurge item name.</p>

<h2 id="label-The+Admin+Zone+and+Positionless+Actions">The Admin Zone and Positionless Actions</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a thing happens that doesn&#39;t belong in any specific game
zone. A player might fail to create a new account - what zone would that
belong in? An admin might reload the whole world, which isn&#39;t specific
to any one zone. An error might occur that can&#39;t be traced to any
specific zone.</p>

<p>When that happens, a special zone name, “admin”, is used. There cannot be
an “admin” zone in a world file. Instead, “admin” is the name of an
automatic InertStateItem which holds system information like how many total
ticks have passed in the world, and the current notification_id and
intention_id for queueing.</p>

<p>Positionless occurrences like the examples above (e.g. account creation
failures) will appear to occur in this nonexistent “admin” zone.</p>
