<p>You&#39;d like to set up a new game with Pixiurge? Great! Let&#39;s talk about
what Pixiurge can do for you, what it makes easy and what will be more
challenging.</p>

<h2>How-To</h2>

<p>To make a game, any game, you&#39;re going to wind up needing assets -
things like graphics, text and so on. You&#39;re going to need to handle
that part, though Pixiurge can make some recommendations.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some boilerplate code you&#39;ll want - a Gemfile, a config.ru and
so on.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Advice</h2>

<h3>Pixiurge is Opinionated</h3>

<p>Pixiurge gives pretty strong defaults for how it thinks games should
look. As a result, it can be very easy to set up a simple game... if
you do it how Pixiurge expects. The more you deviate from what
Pixiurge already does, the more work you&#39;ll have to do to make it
happen.</p>

<p>So: what are its opinions?</p>

<p>First off: Pixiurge only does browser games. If you want to write a
native mobile game or a Windows game or something, Pixiurge basically
won&#39;t help you at all.</p>

<p>Pixiurge is set up for slower-paced simulation games, not twitch
games. Pixiurge needs a network round trip to do <em>anything</em> that
involves the server. That&#39;s fine if you&#39;re building a slow, strategic
game. It sucks if you&#39;re trying to build a multiplayer platformer or a
rhythm game or a shooter. Related: Pixiurge has a client in
garbage-collected Javascript, a server in garbage-collected Ruby, and
uses Websockets (TCP/IP) for transport. This means you <em>will</em> see
short delays at random times and sometimes <em>long</em> delays. This is
another reason not to build your shooter or rhythm game in Pixiurge.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s a good example of Pixiurge-compatible gameplay? A JRPG-style
tiled game where you explore and fight could work great. A
Stardew-Valley style game where you craft or garden fits
nicely. Turn-based combat (X-COM) or conversation (The Walking Dead)
is fine. Strategy games are good.</p>

<p>Pixiurge normally assumes you want multiplayer. You can do some
single-player-style interactions, but... If you&#39;re bothering with a
concurrent event-based Ruby server, you probably want multiple
players. There are simpler ways to build a single-player game where
you don&#39;t use a shared server at all, right?</p>
