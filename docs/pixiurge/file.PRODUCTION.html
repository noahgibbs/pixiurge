<p>FIRST OFF: PIXIURGE IS NOT PRODUCTION-READY. IT MAY WORK, BUT IT HAS
NOT BEEN TESTED AT ANY NONTRIVIAL SCALE.</p>

<p>Still with me? Okay.</p>

<p>Getting a Websocket-aware game with a Ruby server into production has
a lot of pieces to get right. It&#39;ll help if you&#39;ve done this sort of
thing before. But even the pros can use a checklist. I can&#39;t provide
you a fully complete list, but here are some of the things to look
into for your deployment...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pixiurge ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES secure sockets. The dev versions uses a
self-signed certificate, but you&#39;ll need a production certificate
that matches your domain. Otherwise all your users will have to
manually configure their web browsers to accept self-signed certs,
which is NOT OKAY.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll need a nice recent version of Ruby, which probably means
using rvm to compile one. There may or may not be a good one for
your Linux distribution of choice. For preference use the same
version of Ruby you&#39;ve been developing with.</p></li>
<li><p>Pixiurge is deployed on Thin, a Ruby application server. You&#39;ll
either need to look into production settings for it (for instance,
how many threads?) or figure out how to run Pixiurge on another app
server like Puma.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no reason to run Pixiurge as root. Don&#39;t do it. But make
sure permissions are set up properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Most commonly, Pixiurge writes local files to its directory for
things like accounts and state. You&#39;ll need to back these up
regularly. If you want to use a database or something, you&#39;ll need
to make sure Pixiurge is configured for that, which it isn&#39;t right
out of the box.  You&#39;ll <em>still</em> need to back them up regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>A development Pixiurge install sometimes loads a lot of unminified
Javascript. Make sure it got switched to requiring a single minified
release version. In config.ru you can turn off hosting the gem&#39;s
unminified Pixiurge scripts by passing :no_dev_pixiurge and
:no_vendor_pixiurge to app.rack_builder, and you should.</p></li>
</ul>
